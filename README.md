>  ### Hi! I'm Anadya. I am an Indian. 🇮🇳 <br>
> **🌱I am a student and I’m currently learning more in JavaScript.
> I love to code and learn, I love computer science and Art. As of now, I am learning JavaScript, but I can also write other languages as well. 
<br> <br>
> I learned coding with the help of teachers from **https://code.whitehatjr.com** and by watching many coding related YouTube videos.
> I am mainly a self taught programmer, and am doing programming since the beggining of 2020. I have learned a lot in this time period.**
